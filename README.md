Project Overview
This project focuses on satellite image segmentation using a U-Net deep learning model. The main goal is to classify and segment different regions in satellite images efficiently. The model is trained, tested, and deployed on Hugging Face for real-time predictions.

Project Workflow
The project follows a structured approach:

Pre-processing the Satellite Image Dataset

Loaded and pre-processed the dataset for image segmentation.
Applied normalization, resizing, and augmentation techniques to improve model performance.
Training the U-Net Model

Implemented a U-Net architecture for segmentation tasks.
Used appropriate loss functions and optimizers to improve accuracy.
Local Debugging & Testing

Performed error analysis and fine-tuned the model for better performance.
Debugged issues with training and validation losses.
Prediction & Performance Evaluation

Ran the trained model on test images to check segmentation accuracy.
Generated and analyzed segmentation masks.
Deployment on Hugging Face

Exported the model and deployed it on Hugging Face Spaces.
Created an interactive interface for users to upload satellite images and get segmented outputs.
