# Satellite Image Segmentation using U-Net

## Project Overview
This project focuses on satellite image segmentation using a U-Net deep learning model. The main goal is to efficiently classify and segment different regions in satellite images. The model is trained, tested, and deployed on Hugging Face for real-time predictions.

## Project Workflow
The project follows a structured approach:

**1. Pre-processing the Satellite Image Dataset**
Loaded and pre-processed the dataset for image segmentation.
Applied normalization, resizing, and augmentation techniques to improve model performance.

**2. Training the U-Net Model**
Implemented a U-Net architecture for segmentation tasks.
Used appropriate loss functions and optimizers to improve accuracy.

**3. Local Debugging & Testing**
Performed error analysis and fine-tuned the model for better performance.
Debugged issues with training and validation losses.

**4. Prediction & Performance Evaluation**
Ran the trained model on test images to check segmentation accuracy.
Generated and analyzed segmentation masks.

**5. Deployment on Hugging Face**
Exported the model and deployed it on Hugging Face Spaces.
Created an interactive interface for users to upload satellite images and get segmented outputs.

## How to Use the Model?
